 <br><br>Divinity takes many forms in <a data-href="Alteras" href="\countries\alteras.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alteras</a>. For the past three millennia the gods were myths and fables. While some people believed the gods still influenced the world through miracles and omens, and the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Elderon" data-href="Elderon" href="\countries\elderon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eldari Empire</a> claimed their emperor and empress are the personification of their deities, it is only in the past 20 years that true miracles have occurred. Priests have healed wounds, cured diseases, and on occasion, brought the dead back to life.<br><br>Many cultures have their own pantheons, such as the Founders Pantheon of the dwarves or the <a data-href="Spirits of the Land" href="\Spirits of the Land" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Spirits of the Land</a> of the Hendari people. However, there are some deities that span cultures and have followers throughout Alteras.<br><br><br>/bilk-ALL/<br>
Known as a turbulent god with unpredictable moods and reactions, but also determination and persistence, wearing away the shores and cliffs of Alteras. His symbol is a wave crashing against a shore. He is worshipped by sailors fearful of his wrath who offer tribute to ensure a safe journey, or those that are undertaking an arduous task and desire the strength to go on. His temples are near coast lines, ideally with access to the open sea where priests perform rites and rituals during high and low tides.<br><br> /Lo-CAR-us/<br>
God of combat and warriors. He is worshipped by soldiers and gladiators and his temples are schools for martial arts. His symbol is a pair of crossed hand axes. Lokarus is described as tall, handsome man dressed in leather armor. He carries a shield in one hand and a greatsword in his other. He is worshipped by soldiers and gladiators, and his blessing is sought before competitions. His priests are warrior monks and his temples are training schools for different forms of combat.<br><br>/Tay-AH-druh/<br>
The goddess of salvation and navigation. Tai'adra is worshipped by sailors and wanderers seeking safe harbor, by lost souls seeking redemption, and the poor and destitute seeking aid. She is depicted as a young woman dressed in simple peasant clothes of white and blue. Her symbol is a lighthouse tower. She is the patron diety of <a data-href="Fargado" href="\settlements\fargado.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fargado</a>, a city in the south of the <a data-href="Thunder Coast" href="\regions\thunder-coast.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thunder Coast</a>, but her temples are numerous. Often they serve as a place of refuge and succor for those in need as well.<br><br>/zal-THUNE/<br>
Zalthune is a god of honor, loyalty, and duty. He is the oathsworn. He is the god of knights and nobles who believe in doing what is right and those that hold their word above all else. He is often depicted as a great golden stag. As a mortal, he is seen as a plate armored warrior wielding a heavy shield and warhammer. His temples are often austere inside. They contain beautiful gardens where the priests maintain spaces for mediation and reflection.<br><br>/Zi-CAR/<br>
Zek'ar, known as the Hangman, is the goddess of justice and retribution. She believes in doing what is right, which does not always mean following the letter of the law. Her symbol is a gallows with an empty noose. She is worshipped and called upon whenever someone feels they have been wronged, especially when there is no redress through lawful means. Those seeking vengeance may visit one of her temples and request aid from her priests or clerics.<br><br><br>/Ha-lawn/<br>
Goddess of secrets and hidden things. Worshipped by few but called on for favors when someone wishes to either hide something or find something out. Her symbol is a spiderweb composed of stars in the night sky. She is depicted as a dark-haired, pale woman in elegant, dark clothing. Her temples and shrines are in hidden places.]]></description><link>divine-beings.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Divine Beings.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:35:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[<a data-href="Alteras" href="countries/alteras.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alteras</a>]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>The world is called Alteras. <br><br>The continent the current campaigns takes place on.<br><img alt="Kiranthia" src="\references\images\kiranthia.png"><br><br><br><br>The Thunder Coast is a stretch of a few hundred miles on the southeast <a data-href="Kiranthia" href="\regions\kiranthia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kiranthia</a>. The coast itself is rocky and mostly barren, with high cliffs and booming surf that gives it its name. Low mountains, covered in dense forest rise up from the coast. The region gets heavy rain and thunderstorms and is sparsely populated. There are only two spots along the coast suitable for ships and both have small ports where minerals and timber from inland are milled and sold to passing merchants.<br>It recently won a war for independence from the Eldari Empire and is now debating their future rule.]]></description><link>geography.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Geography.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 23:08:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="references\images\kiranthia.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="references\images\kiranthia.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
