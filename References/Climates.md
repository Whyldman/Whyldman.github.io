# Tropical Climates
[Tropical climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate") are characterized by constant high temperatures (at sea level and low elevations); all 12 months of the year have average temperatures of 18 °C (64.4 °F) or higher; and generally high annual precipitation. They are subdivided as follows:
## Tropical Rainforest Climate
A **tropical rainforest climate** or **equatorial climate** is a [tropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate") sub-type usually found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"). There are some other areas at higher latitudes, such as the coast of southeast Florida, United States, and Okinawa, Japan that fall into the tropical rainforest climate category. They experience high mean annual temperatures, small temperature ranges, and rain that falls throughout the year. Regions with this climate are typically designated _**Af**_ by the [Köppen climate classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"). A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot, very humid, and wet.

## Tropical Savanna
n tropical savanna climates, the dry season can become severe, and often drought conditions prevail during the course of the year. Tropical savanna climates often feature tree-studded grasslands due to its dryness, rather than thick jungle. It is this widespread occurrence of tall, coarse grass (called savanna) which has led to Aw and As climates often being referred to as the tropical savanna. However, there is some doubt whether tropical grasslands are climatically induced. Additionally, pure savannas, without trees, are the exception rather than the rule.

### Versions

There are generally four types of tropical savanna climates:

- Distinct [wet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season "Wet season") and [dry seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season "Dry season") of relatively equal duration. Most of the region's annual rainfall is experienced during the wet season and very little precipitation falls during the dry season.
- A lengthy dry season and a relatively short wet season. This version features seven or more dry season months and five or fewer wet season months. There are more variations within this version:
    - On one extreme, the region receives just enough precipitation during the short wet season to preclude it from a [semi-arid climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate) classification. This drier variation of the tropical savanna climate is typically found adjacent to regions with hot semi-arid (_BSh_) climates.
    - On the other extreme, the climate features a lengthy dry season followed by a short but extremely rainy wet season. However, regions with this variation of the climate do not experience enough rainfall during the wet season to qualify as a [tropical monsoon climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_monsoon_climate "Tropical monsoon climate"). These can be found near tropical monsoon climates.
- A lengthy wet season and a relatively short dry season. This version features seven or more wet season months and five or fewer dry season months. This version's precipitation pattern is similar to precipitation patterns observed in some tropical monsoon climates but does not experience enough rainfall during the wet season to be classified as such.
- A dry season with a noticeable amount of rainfall followed by a rainy wet season. In essence, this version mimics the precipitation patterns more commonly found in a tropical monsoon climate, but do not receive enough precipitation during either the dry season or the year to be classified as such.
## Tropical Monsoon Climate
An **area of tropical monsoon climate** (occasionally known as a **sub-equatorial**, **tropical wet climate** or a **tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral climate**) is a [tropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate") sub-type that corresponds to the [Köppen climate classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") category _**Am**_. Tropical monsoon climates have monthly mean temperatures above 18 °C (64 °F) in every month of the year and a dry season.

In essence, a tropical monsoon climate tends to either have more rainfall than a tropical savanna climate or have less pronounced dry seasons. A tropical monsoon climate tends to vary less in temperature during a year than does a tropical savanna climate. This climate has a driest month which nearly always occurs at or soon after the winter solstice.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_monsoon_climate#cite_note-McKnight-1)

### Two Variations
- Less pronounced dry seasons. Regions with this variation of the tropical monsoon climate typically see copious amounts of rain during the wet season(s), usually in the form of frequent thunderstorms. Unlike most tropical savanna climates, a sizeable amount of precipitation also falls during the dry season(s). In essence, this version of the tropical monsoon climate generally has less pronounced dry seasons than tropical savanna climates.
- Extraordinarily rainy wet seasons and pronounced dry seasons. This variation features pronounced dry seasons similar in length and character to dry seasons observed in tropical savanna climates. This is followed by a sustained period (or sustained periods) of extraordinary rainfall. In some instances, up to (and sometimes in excess of) 1,000 mm of precipitation is observed per month for two or more consecutive months. Tropical savanna climates generally do not see this level of sustained rainfall.
# Arid Climates
Not much rain

## Hot Desert Climate
At the time of high sun (summer), scorching, desiccating heat prevails. Hot-month average temperatures are normally between 29 and 35 °C (84 and 95 °F), and midday readings of 43–46 °C (109–115 °F) are common. The world absolute heat records, over 50 °C (122 °F), are generally in the hot deserts, where the heat potential can be the highest on the planet. This includes the record of 56.7 °C (134.1 °F) in [Death Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley "Death Valley") Some deserts in the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics") consistently experience very high temperatures all year long, even during wintertime. These locations feature some of the highest annual average temperatures recorded on Earth, exceeding 30 °C (86 °F), up to nearly 35 °C (95 °F) in [Dallol, Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallol,_Ethiopia "Dallol, Ethiopia"). This last feature is seen in sections of Africa and [Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia "Arabia"). During colder periods of the year, night-time temperatures can drop to freezing or below due to the exceptional radiation loss under the clear skies. However, very rarely do temperatures drop far below freezing under the hot subtype.

Hot deserts are lands of extremes: most of them are among the hottest, the driest and the sunniest places on Earth because of nearly constant high pressure; the nearly permanent removal of low-pressure systems, dynamic fronts and atmospheric disturbances; sinking air motion; dry atmosphere near the surface and aloft; the exacerbated exposure to the sun where solar angles are always high makes this desert inhospitable to most species.

## Cold Desert Climate
Cold desert climates (_BWk_) usually feature hot (or warm in a few instances), dry summers, though summers are not typically as hot as hot desert climates. Unlike hot desert climates, cold desert climates tend to feature cold, dry winters. Snow tends to be rare in regions with this climate. The [Gobi Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi_Desert "Gobi Desert") in northern China and Mongolia is one example of cold desert. Though hot in the summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of [Inner Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Asia "Inner Asia"). Summers in South America's [Atacama Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert "Atacama Desert") are mild with only slight temperature variations between seasons. Cold desert climates are typically found at higher altitudes than hot desert climates and are usually drier than hot desert climates.

## Hot Semi-Arid Climate
Hot semi-arid climates (type "BSh") tend to be located in the 20s and 30s latitudes of the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics") and [subtropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics "Subtropics"), typically in proximity to regions with a [tropical savanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_savanna_climate "Tropical savanna climate"), [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate"), and [hot desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_desert_climate "Hot desert climate") climates. These climates tend to have hot, or sometimes extremely hot, summers and warm to cool winters, with some to minimal precipitation. Hot semi-arid climates are most commonly found around the fringes of subtropical deserts.

## Cold Semi-Arid Climate
Cold semi-arid climates (type "BSk") tend to be located in elevated portions of [temperate zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_zones "Temperate zones"), typically bordering a [humid continental climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate "Humid continental climate") or a [Mediterranean climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate"). They are also typically found in continental interiors some distance from large bodies of water. Cold semi-arid climates usually feature warm to hot dry summers, though their summers are typically not quite as hot as those of hot semi-arid climates. Unlike hot semi-arid climates, areas with cold semi-arid climates tend to have cold and possibly freezing winters. These areas usually see some [snowfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowfall "Snowfall") during the winter, though snowfall is much lower than at locations at similar latitudes with more humid climates.

Areas featuring cold semi-arid climates tend to have higher elevations than areas with hot semi-arid climates, and tend to feature major temperature swings between day and night, sometimes by as much as 20 °C (36 °F) or more. These large [diurnal temperature variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation "Diurnal temperature variation") are seldom seen in hot semi-arid climates. Cold semi-arid climates at higher latitudes tend to have dry winters and wetter summers, while cold semi-arid climates at lower latitudes tend to have precipitation patterns more akin to [subtropical climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_climate "Subtropical climate"), with dry summers, relatively wet winters, and even wetter springs and autumns.

# Temperate Climates

## Humid Subtropical Climate
[[Humid Subtropical]]
Coldest month averaging above 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C (27 °F)), at least one month's average temperature above 22 °C (71.6 °F), and at least four months averaging above 10 °C (50 °F). No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled). No dry months in the summer.

In a humid subtropical climate, summers are typically long, hot and humid. A deep current of tropical air dominates the humid subtropics at the time of high sun, and daily intense (but brief) convective thundershowers are common. Monthly mean temperatures in winter may be mild or slightly above freezing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate#cite_note-4)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate#cite_note-5)

Rainfall often shows a summer peak especially where storms reaching the level of [monsoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon") are well developed, as in Southeast Asia and [South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon_of_South_Asia "Monsoon of South Asia").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate#cite_note-6) Other areas have a more uniform or varying rainfall cycles but consistently lack any predictably dry summer months unlike [Mediterranean climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate"). Most summer rainfall occurs during [thunderstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-mass_thunderstorm "Air-mass thunderstorm") that build up due to the intense surface heating and strong subtropical sun angle. Weak [tropical lows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_low "Tropical low") that move in from adjacent warm tropical oceans, as well as infrequent tropical storms often contribute to summer seasonal rainfall peaks. Winter rainfall is often associated with large storms in the [westerlies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies "Westerlies") that have fronts that reach down into subtropical latitudes.

## Temperate Oceanic (Marine)
Coldest month averaging above 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C (27 °F)), all months with average temperatures below 22 °C (71.6 °F), and at least four months averaging above 10 °C (50 °F). No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled).

Generally featuring cool summers and mild winters (for their latitude), with a relatively narrow annual [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") range and few extremes of temperature. Locations with oceanic climates tend to feature frequent cloudy conditions with precipitation, low hanging clouds, and frequent fronts and storms. Thunderstorms are normally few, since strong daytime heating and hot and cold air masses meet infrequently in the regions, but are more common in subtropical highland climates where these air masses meet more frequently due to the influence of hotter weather in the subtropics or tropics, especially in monsoon-influenced climates. In most areas with an oceanic climate, precipitation comes in the form of rain for the majority of the year. Most oceanic climate zones, or at least a part of them, however, experience at least one snowfall per year. Snowfall is more frequent and commonplace in the subpolar oceanic climates due to the colder weather in those locations.

Overall [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") characteristics of the oceanic climates feature cool temperatures and infrequent extremes of temperature.
## Subtropical Highland Climates
Coldest month averaging above 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C (27 °F)), all months with average temperatures below 22 °C (71.6 °F), and at least four months averaging above 10 °C (50 °F). No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled).

The subtropical highland climate is a climate variety often grouped together with oceanic climates which exists in some mountainous or elevated portions of the world in either the subtropics or tropics. Despite the latitude, the higher [elevations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation "Elevation") of these regions mean that the climate shares characteristics with oceanic climates.

Subtropical highland climates with uniform rainfall (_Cfb_) usually have rainfall spread relatively evenly throughout the year, similar to other oceanic climates but unlike these climates, they have a high [diurnal temperature variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation "Diurnal temperature variation") and low humidity, owing to their inland location and relatively high elevation. Subtropical highland climates with [monsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon") influence (_Cwb_), have distinctive [wet summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season "Wet season") and [dry winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season "Dry season").

In locations outside the tropics, other than the drying trend in the winter, subtropical highland climates tend to be essentially identical to an oceanic climate, with mild summers and noticeably cooler winters, plus, in some instances, some snowfall.

## Subpolar Oceanic
Areas with subpolar oceanic climates feature an oceanic climate but are usually located closer to polar regions, with long but relatively mild winters and short, cool summers. As a result of their location, these regions tend to be on the cool end of oceanic climates, approaching to [polar regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions_of_Earth "Polar regions of Earth"). Snowfall tends to be more common here than in other oceanic climates. Subpolar oceanic climates are less prone to temperature extremes than [subarctic climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic_climate "Subarctic climate") or [continental climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate "Continental climate"), featuring milder winters than these climates. Subpolar oceanic climates feature only one to three months of average monthly temperatures that are at least 10 °C (50 °F). As with oceanic climates, none of its average monthly temperatures fall below -3.0 °C (26.6 °F) or 0 °C depending on the isotherm used. Typically, these areas in the warmest month experience daytime maximum temperatures below 17 °C (63 °F), while the coldest month features highs near or slightly above freezing and lows just below freezing while keeping the average warm enough.

# Mediterranean Climate

A **Mediterranean climate** ([/ˌmɛdɪtəˈreɪniən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_MED-ih-tə-RAY-nee-ən_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")), also called a **dry summer climate**, described by [Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") as _**Cs**_, is a [temperate climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate "Temperate climate") type that occurs in the lower mid-latitudes (normally 30 to 44 north and south latitude). Such climates typically have dry summers and wet winters, with summer conditions ranging from warm to hot and winter conditions typically being mild to cool. These weather conditions are typically experienced in the majority of Mediterranean-climate regions and countries, but remain highly dependent on proximity to the ocean, altitude and geographical location.

 Areas with this climate are also where the so-called "Mediterranean trinity" of major agricultural crops have traditionally been successfully grown ([wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat"), [grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape "Grape") and [olives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive "Olive")). As a result, these regions are notable for their high-quality wines, grapeseed/olive oils, and bread products.

## Hot Summer Mediterranean Climate
This subtype of the Mediterranean climate (_Csa_) is the most common form of the Mediterranean climate, therefore it is also known as a "typical Mediterranean climate". As stated earlier, regions with this form of a Mediterranean climate experience average monthly temperatures in excess of 22.0 °C (71.6 °F) during its warmest month and an average in the coldest month between 18 and −3 °C (64 and 27 °F) or, in some applications, between 18 and 0 °C (64 and 32 °F). Also, at least four months must average above 10 °C (50 °F) to avoid becoming a cold-summer Mediterranean subtype. Regions with this form of the Mediterranean climate typically experience hot, sometimes very hot and dry summers and mild, wet winters. In a number of instances, summers here can closely resemble summers seen in [arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate "Desert climate") and [semi-arid climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") and be close to the thresholds for them. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water nearby. Winters can be mild, cool or chilly, and some cities in this region receive some snowfall while others do not.

## Warm-summer Mediterranean Climate
Occasionally also termed the "Cool-summer Mediterranean climate", this subtype of the Mediterranean climate (_Csb_) is less common and experience warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 22 °C (72 °F) during its warmest month and as usual an average in the coldest month between 18 and −3 °C (64 and 27 °F) or, in some applications, between 18 and 0 °C (64 and 32 °F).

Also, at least four months must average above 10 °C (50 °F) once again. Cool ocean currents, upwelling and higher [latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") are often the reason for this cooler type of Mediterranean climate.

The other main reason for this cooler type is the [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude"). For instance, [Menton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menton "Menton") on the French coast has a Csa climate while [Castellar, Alpes-Maritimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellar,_Alpes-Maritimes "Castellar, Alpes-Maritimes"), the adjacent town just north of Menton, with an altitude between 100 and 1,382 m (328 and 4,534 ft), has a Csb climate instead.

Winters are rainy and can be mild to chilly. In some instances, snow can fall on these areas. Precipitation occurs often in the colder seasons, but there are a number of clear sunny days even during the wetter seasons.

## Cold-summer Mediterranean Climate
The cold-summer subtype of the Mediterranean climate (_Csc_) is rare and predominately found at scattered high-altitude locations along the west coasts of North and South America having a similar climate. This type is characterized by cool, dry summers, with less than four months with a mean temperature at or above 10 °C (50 °F), as well as with cool, wet winters, with no winter month having a mean temperature below 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C [27 °F]), depending on the isotherm used). Regions with this climate are influenced by the dry-summer trend (though briefly) that extends considerably poleward along the west coast of the Americas, as well as the moderating influences of high altitude and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean. These conditions maintain an unusually narrow temperature range through the year for climate zones at such distances from coasts.

# Continental Climates

This type of climate has at least one month averaging below 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C (27 °F)) and at least one month averaging above 10 °C (50 °F).

## Humid Continental Climate
Typified by four distinct seasons and large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold in the northern areas) winters. Precipitation is usually distributed throughout the year, but often these regions do have dry seasons. The definition of this climate in terms of temperature is as follows: the mean temperature of the coldest month must be below 0 °C (32.0 °F) or −3 °C (26.6 °F) depending on the isotherm, and there must be at least four months whose mean temperatures are at or above 10 °C (50 °F). In addition, the location in question must not be [semi-arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") or [arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate "Desert climate").

- _s_: A dry summer—the driest month in the high-sun half of the year (April to September in the Northern Hemisphere, October to March in the Southern Hemisphere) has less than 30 millimetres (1.18 in)/40 millimetres (1.57 in) of rainfall and has exactly or less than 1⁄3 the precipitation of the wettest month in the low-sun half of the year (October to March in the Northern Hemisphere, April to September in the Southern Hemisphere).
- _w_: A dry winter—the driest month in the low-sun half of the year has exactly or less than one‑tenth of the precipitation found in the wettest month in the summer half of the year.
- _f_: No dry season—does not meet either of the alternative specifications above; precipitation and humidity are often high year-round. 
 
while the third letter denotes the extent of summer heat:

- _a_: Hot summer, warmest month averages at least 22 °C (71.6 °F),
- _b_: Warm summer, warmest month averages below 22 °C (71.6 °F) but at least four months averages above 10 °C (50.0 °F).
### Vegetation
By definition, [forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest "Forest") thrive within this climate. [Biomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome "Biome") within this climate regime include temperate woodlands, temperate grasslands, temperate deciduous or evergreen forests, coniferous forests, and coniferous swamps. Within wetter areas, [maple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple "Maple"), [spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce "Spruce"), [pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine "Pine"), [fir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir "Fir"), and [oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak "Oak") can be found. Fall foliage is noted during the autumn of deciduous forests.

## Subarctic Climate
This type of climate offers some of the most extreme seasonal temperature variations found on the planet: in winter, temperatures can drop to below −50 °C (−58 °F) and in summer, the temperature may exceed 26 °C (79 °F). However, the summers are short; no more than three months of the year (but at least one month) must have a 24-hour average temperature of at least 10 °C (50 °F) to fall into this category of climate, and the coldest month should average below 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C (27 °F)). Record low temperatures can approach −70 °C (−94 °F).

With 5–7 consecutive months when the average temperature is below freezing, all moisture in the soil and subsoil freezes solidly to depths of many feet. Summer warmth is insufficient to thaw more than a few surface feet, so [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost "Permafrost") prevails under most areas not near the southern boundary of this climate zone. Seasonal thaw penetrates from 2 to 14 ft (0.6 to 4.3 m), depending on latitude, aspect, and type of ground. Some northern areas with subarctic climates located near oceans (southern [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska"), the northern fringe of Europe, [Sakhalin Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin_Oblast "Sakhalin Oblast") and [Kamchatka Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka_Oblast "Kamchatka Oblast")), have milder winters and no permafrost, and are more suited for farming unless precipitation is excessive. The frost-free season is very short, varying from about 45 to 100 days at most, and a freeze can occur anytime outside the summer months in many areas.

### Subarctic Vegetation
[Vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation "Vegetation") in regions with subarctic climates is generally of low diversity, as only hardy tree species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers. [Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree "Tree") are mostly limited to [conifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta "Pinophyta"), as few broadleaved trees are able to survive the very low temperatures in winter. This type of forest is also known as [taiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga "Taiga"), a term which is sometimes applied to the climate found therein as well. Even though the diversity may be low, the area and numbers are high, and the taiga (boreal) forest is the largest forest biome on the planet, with most of the forests located in [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") and [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"). The process by which plants become acclimated to cold temperatures is called [hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(botany) "Hardening (botany)").

Agricultural potential is generally poor, due to the natural infertility of soils and the prevalence of swamps and lakes left by departing [ice sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet "Ice sheet"), and short growing seasons prohibit all but the hardiest of crops. Despite the short season, the long summer days at such latitudes do permit some agriculture. In some areas, ice has scoured rock surfaces bare, entirely stripping off the overburden. Elsewhere, rock basins have been formed and stream courses dammed, creating countless lakes.
# Polar and Alpine Climates

## Tundra Climate
 It is a climate which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (0 °C (32 °F)), but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 °C (50 °F).

It is important to note the existence of another variation called [alpine tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_tundra "Alpine tundra"). Alpine tundra refers to the tundra environment found at high altitudes, usually above the treeline. It is mostly located at high elevation [montane grasslands and shrublands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_grasslands_and_shrublands "Montane grasslands and shrublands"), including the [puna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puna_grassland "Puna grassland") and [páramo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1ramo "Páramo") in South America, [subalpine heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalpine_zone "Subalpine zone") in New Guinea and East Africa, [steppes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe "Steppe") of the Tibetan plateaus, as well as other similar subalpine habitats around the world. This type of tundra climate exhibits similar characteristics to its polar counterpart but is specifically associated with elevated landscapes.

## Ice Cap Climate
Ice caps are defined as a climate with no months above 0 °C (32 °F). Such areas are found around the north and south pole, and on the top of many high mountains. Since the temperature never exceeds the melting point of ice, any snow or ice that accumulates remains there permanently, over time forming a large [ice sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet "Ice sheet").

The ice cap climate is distinct from the [tundra climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_climate "Tundra climate"), or _ET_. A tundra climate has a summer season with temperatures consistently above freezing for several months. This summer is enough to melt the winter ice cover, which prevents the formation of ice sheets. Because of this, [tundras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundras "Tundras") have vegetation, while ice caps do not.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
